# MAG

Welcome to **m**etauni **A**lgebraic **G**eometry. This is a series of online algebraic geometry classes taught at [metauni](https://metauni.org), using Roblox for the 3D virtual environment and voice chat and Discord for community.

We are currently preparing MAG1, a first course in algebraic geometry, which will be free and open to anyone with an Internet connection who is over the age of 13 (Roblox voice chat requires age verification).

* **When**: starting mid-June 2022, weekly **1.5 hour** lectures on Thursdays 7:00-8:30am AEST, weekly **1 hour** exercise sessions (times TBA). The class will run for 8-9 weeks. There will be two graded assignments but no exam.
* **Where**: [metauni](https://metauni.org), where we can write on shared virtual blackboards (which retain their contents when you leave) and talk using position-based voice chat (people far away can't hear you) and the [metauni Discord](https://discord.gg/9yBaAxPSK8). See the [instructions](https://metauni.org/posts/instructions/instructions) for how to set it up.
* **Why**: to introduce the beauty of algebraic geometry in a hands-on way, emphasising the link between classical ideas and modern computation.
* **What**: the textbook is D. A. Cox, J. Little, D. O’Shea "[Ideals, Varieties, and Algorithms](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-16721-3)", referred to below as **CLO**.

The *who* is a community of volunteers:

* **Lecturers**: [Dan Murfet](https://www.therisingsea.org) and Ken Chan, both with PhDs in algebraic geometry.
* **Tutors**: Edmund Lau, Rohan Hitchcock and Will Troiani (and you?).
* **Illustrators**: Ethan Curtiss (AstroCode) and Mathias (and you?).

The class will be limited to 30 people. **Subscribe to the mailing list** to be notified when registration opens, and to receive other course updates.

## Pre-requisities

High school algebra plus a little bit of linear algebra (a basic familiarity with matrices). More precisely, you should have experience working with polynomials in small numbers of variables and low degree. You should know 

* How to find the roots of a quadratic polynomial, 
* How to plot `q(x,y)=0` where `q` is a quadratic polynomial,
* How to differentiate a polynomial,
* How to multiply matrices and do row operations.

You should be comfortable with functions and terms like [domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_of_a_function), [codomain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codomain), [image and preimage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_(mathematics)), [injective, surjective, bijective](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bijection,_injection_and_surjection), [union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_(set_theory)), [intersection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersection_(set_theory)) and [complement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complement_(set_theory)). 

## Course content

There will be a two week pre-course covering polynomials and polynomial rings, ideals and set-theoretic operations. Roughly each bullet point below will be one 1.5hr lecture (references are to **CLO**). Lecture notes will be posted before classes.

* §2.5: The Hilbert Basis Theorem and Gröbner Bases
* §2.6: Properties of Gröbner Bases.
* §2.7: Buchberger’s Algorithm.
* §2.8: First Applications of Gröbner Bases.

## Exercise sessions

The volunteer tutors will take turns hosting the exercise sessions, in which groups of students will work together at virtual boards, with a roving tutor assisting. Exercises will be assigned beforehand and students will be encouraged to make a start on problems before the exercise sessions.

## Hardware

At metauni learning is centered on virtual blackboards that we call *metaboards*. It is therefore essential that you have access to a tablet with stylus, in order to collaborate on the metaboards with other students. Tablets that plug into your computer via USB can be found for as little as AUD$50. Members of our community have successfully used the following products:

* XP-PEN G640 graphics tablet (~AUD$50)
* [Wacom Intuos](https://www.wacom.com/en-au/products/pen-tablets/wacom-intuos) (~AUD$250)
* [Apple iPad](https://www.apple.com/au/shop/buy-ipad/ipad-10-2/64gb-space-grey-wifi) with Apple Pencil (~AUD$650)
