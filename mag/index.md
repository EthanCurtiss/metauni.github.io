# MAG

Welcome to **m**etauni **A**lgebraic **G**eometry. This is a series of online algebraic geometry classes taught at [metauni](https://metauni.org), using Roblox for the 3D virtual environment and voice chat and Discord for community. We are currently preparing MAG1, a first course in algebraic geometry, to begin in mid-June. It will be free to attend and open to anyone with an Internet connection who is over the age of 13 (since Roblox voice chat requires age verification).

This is a community-based class being prepared by:

* **Lecturers**: [Dan Murfet](https://www.therisingsea.org) and Ken Chan.
* **Tutors**: Edmund Lau, Rohan Hitchcock and Will Troiani (and you?).
* **Illustrators**: Ethan Curtiss (AstroCode) and Mathias (and you?).
* **Textbook**: D. A. Cox, J. Little, D. O’Shea "[Ideals, Varieties, and Algorithms](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-16721-3)", referred to below as **CLO**.
