# MAG

Welcome to **m**etauni **A**lgebraic **G**eometry. This is a series of online algebraic geometry classes taught at [metauni](https://metauni.org), using Roblox for the 3D virtual environment and voice chat and Discord for community.

</p>

We are currently preparing MAG1, a first course in algebraic geometry, which will be free and open to anyone with an Internet connection who is over the age of 13 (Roblox voice chat requires age verification).

* **When**: starting mid-June 2022, weekly **1.5 hour** lectures on Thursdays 7:00-8:30am AEST, weekly **1 hour** exercise sessions (times TBA). The class will run for 8-9 weeks. There will be two graded assignments but no exam.
* **Where**: [metauni](https://metauni.org), where we can write on shared virtual blackboards (which retain their contents when you leave) and talk using position-based voice chat (people far away can't hear you) and the [metauni Discord](https://discord.gg/9yBaAxPSK8). See the [instructions](https://metauni.org/posts/instructions/instructions) for how to set it up.
* **Why**: to introduce the beauty of algebraic geometry in a hands-on way, emphasising the link between classical ideas and modern computation.
* **What**: the textbook is D. A. Cox, J. Little, D. O’Shea "[Ideals, Varieties, and Algorithms](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-16721-3)", referred to below as **CLO**. You don't need a copy as we'll post our own lecture notes based on the book, but it's a great book and we recommend getting a copy.

The *who* is a community of volunteers:

* **Lecturers**: [Dan Murfet](https://www.therisingsea.org) and Ken Chan, both with PhDs in algebraic geometry.
* **Tutors**: [Edmund Lau](https://edmundlth.github.io), Rohan Hitchcock and [Will Troiani](https://williamtroiani.github.io) (and you?).
* **Illustrators**: [Ethan Curtiss](https://twitter.com/AstroCodeRblx) (AstroCode) and [Mathias](https://twitter.com/draainhp) (and you?).

The class will be limited to 30 people. **Subscribe to the mailing list** to be notified when registration opens, and to receive other course updates.

## Course content

There will be a two week pre-course covering polynomials and polynomial rings, ideals and set-theoretic operations. Roughly each bullet point below will be one 1.5hr lecture (references are to **CLO**). Lecture notes will be posted before classes.

* §1.1: Polynomials and Affine Space
* §1.2, 1.3: Affine Varieties, parametrizations of Affine Varieties
* §2.1: Introduction to Gröbner Bases
* §2.2: Orderings of Monomials
* §2.3: Division Algorithm
* §2.4: Monomial Ideals and Dickson’s Lemma
* §2.5: The Hilbert Basis Theorem and Gröbner Bases
* §2.6: Properties of Gröbner Bases
* §2.7: Buchberger’s Algorithm
* §2.8: First Applications of Gröbner Bases
* §3.1: The Elimination and Extension Theorems
* §3.1, 3.2: The Elimination and Extension Theorems, The Geometry of Elimination

Two assignments will be given during the class, taken from previously assigned exercises. Students will be encouraged to work in groups on these assignments, including during exercise sessions.

## Illustrations

In a virtual world we can *use the environment* to communicate ideas, using code; we call these *illustrations*.

## Exercise sessions

The volunteer tutors will take turns hosting the exercise sessions, in which groups of students will work together at virtual boards, with a roving tutor assisting. Exercises will be assigned beforehand and students will be encouraged to make a start on problems before the exercise sessions.

## Pre-requisites

High school algebra plus a little bit of linear algebra (a basic familiarity with matrices). More precisely, you should have experience working with polynomials in small numbers of variables and low degree. You should know 

* How to find the roots of a quadratic polynomial, 
* How to plot `q(x,y)=0` where `q` is a quadratic polynomial,
* How to differentiate a polynomial,
* How to multiply matrices and do row operations.

You should also be comfortable with functions and terms like [domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_of_a_function), [codomain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codomain), [image and preimage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_(mathematics)), [injective, surjective, bijective](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bijection,_injection_and_surjection), [union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_(set_theory)), [intersection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersection_(set_theory)) and [complement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complement_(set_theory)). If you want to brush up, here are some modules from Khan Academy that cover the necessary background:

* [Introduction to Algebra](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra-home/alg-intro-to-algebra)
* [Polynomial expressions, equations and functions](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra-home/alg-polynomials)
* [Matrices](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra-home/alg-matrices) up to "Row-echelon form and Gaussian elimination"
* [Basic set operations](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability/probability-library/basic-set-ops/v/intersection-and-union-of-sets).
* [Functions](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra-home/alg-functions).

## Hardware

At metauni learning is centered on virtual blackboards that we call *metaboards*. It is therefore recommended that you have access to a tablet with stylus, in order to collaborate on the metaboards with other students. Tablets that plug into your computer via USB can be found for as little as AUD$50. Members of our community have successfully used the following products:

* [XP-PEN G640](https://www.storexp-pen.com.au/buy/54.html) graphics tablet (~AUD$50)
* [XP-PEN Deco 01v2](https://www.storexp-pen.com.au/buy/73.html) graphics tablet  (~AUD$80)
* [Apple iPad](https://www.apple.com/au/shop/buy-ipad/ipad-10-2/64gb-space-grey-wifi) with Apple Pencil (~AUD$650)
* Apple iPad Pro with Apple Pencil (~AUD$1650)

In some countries Roblox may not be available through the Store for your device, in which case you should go with the USB tablet plugged into your PC. The USB tablets may not have a built-in screen, but when you hover the pen above a graphics tablet, the mouse onscreen follows your pen.

What doesn't work:

* Huion H610 Pro V2
* The [Wacom Intuos small](https://www.wacom.com/en-au/products/pen-tablets/wacom-intuos)
