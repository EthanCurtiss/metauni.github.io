# Virtual Reality

One of the reasons we have chosen to build metauni on top of Roblox is the wide accessibility of that platform: it can be accessed on PC, Mac, iOS and Android and also using Virtual Reality (VR) headsets such as the Meta Quest 2. While current headsets are relatively expensive and inconvenient, we believe that over time VR will become one of the main ways that people choose to access metauni. To this end, we are in the process of building virtual reality support into all of the metauni tools, such as [metaboard](https://github.com/metauni/metaboard) and [metaorb](https://github.com/metauni/orb).

So far members of our community have experience only with the [Meta Quest 2](https://store.facebook.com/au/quest/products/quest-2/) so this text will include specific references to Quest 2 hardware, but everything should work with other headsets (such as the Valve Index). At the moment VR support in Roblox is sufficient but not first-class, in the sense that the only way to run Roblox is by tethering your headset to a PC on which Roblox is running. This tethering is either achieved by a [link cable](https://store.facebook.com/au/quest/accessories/quest-2/link-cable/) or by Air Link, which allows your headset to play games running on your PC via a wireless connection.

* Accessing the Nexus VR character menu
* Accessing spatial voice

Here are some things you can try at metauni in VR:

* Write on a metaboard (if you have Scribe permissions)
* View [Songspires](https://www.roblox.com/games/8157928012/Songspires), hit `Y` on your controller to enter Cinecam.
