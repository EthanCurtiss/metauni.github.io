# Virtual Reality

One of the reasons we have chosen to build metauni on top of Roblox is the wide accessibility of that platform: it can be accessed on PC, Mac, iOS and Android and also using Virtual Reality (VR) headsets such as the Meta Quest 2. We are in the process of building virtual reality support into all of the metauni tools, such as [metaboard](https://github.com/metauni/metaboard) and [metaorb](https://github.com/metauni/orb).

Here are some things you can try at metauni in VR:

* Write on a metaboard (if you have Scribe permissions)
* View [Songspires](https://www.roblox.com/games/8157928012/Songspires), hit `Y` on your controller to enter Cinecam.
