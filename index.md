# Free University of the Metaverse

The Free University is [on Roblox](https://www.roblox.com/games/6233302798/Metauni), a utility platform for persistent large-scale 3D social environments (see [Baszucki keynote](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G00GlCJc0mU)). It is free in the sense of [freedom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_University_of_Berlin). In its current iteration localised voice chat is based on Discord, one of the largest real-time communication platforms in the world.
