Metauni is a communitary of scholars in the Metaverse, based on a 3D virtual environment provided by [Roblox](https://www.roblox.com/), location-specific voice chat using [Discord](https://www.discord.com) and tools such as whiteboards that we have [scripted in Lua](http://metauni.org/posts/make-your-own/tools). Access is possible on PC, Mac, iOS and Android. It is free in the sense of [freedom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_University_of_Berlin) and [freethought](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_thought) and aspires to be both beautiful and fun. Watch the [video intro](https://youtu.be/66MzfGqJFcA).

**Quick start (Rising Sea node)**: install [Roblox](https://www.roblox.com/) and [Discord](https://www.discord.com) programs, join the [TRS Discord](https://discord.gg/9yBaAxPSK8) and [TRS Roblox world](https://www.roblox.com/games/6224932973/The-Rising-Sea) and in Discord send a message `!register Wintermute` in the `#registration` channel where `Wintermute` is your Roblox username. See the [instructions](https://metauni.org/posts/instructions/instructions) for more details.

## Loci

A [locus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_loci) is a virtual place for intellectual activity, organised around [talking boards](https://youtu.be/39d4g1ERDpw) on a particular topic and scheduled office hours where the host is available for discussion.

* **LC001 - Matrix factorisations** [Roblox](https://www.roblox.com/games/6461013759/metauni-LC001), [TRS Discord](https://discord.gg/9yBaAxPSK8) voice channel `LC001`. Next office hours `TBA`.
* **LC002 - Research Agora** [Roblox](https://www.roblox.com/games/7168699181/metauni-LC002-Research-Agora), [TRS Discord](https://discord.gg/9yBaAxPSK8) voice channel `LC002`. Next office hours `TBA`.
