    Some high level principles and guidelines
---

Metauni is a new institution of higher learning, founded in early 2021. This is a working document which aims to explain what is going on here. Some of the discussion is abstract: for more on how to instantiate these principles concretely, see the [praxis page](https://metauni.org/praxis/).

## Guiding principles

1. Virtual Is Real
2. Celebrate Purposelessness
3. Beauty Is Infrastructure
4. In Wildness

## 1. Virtual is Real

Metauni is not built out of atoms, but it is nonetheless a real place. Many things are real but not physical: for example money and laws are real because they have real effects on the way we think and act, and there is a distributed consensus in the minds of millions of people on the subject of what money and laws are.

The way in which virtual worlds can be real is different, however, because they involve in a fundamental way a simulation of space. A virtual world starts to become real when people spend a large amount of time there interacting in a way that depends on the simulation of physical space, when they form memories of those interactions, and those interactions shape who they are, the relationships they form and the ideas they have.

Our observation at metauni over the past few years has been that when people meet to discuss ideas that matter deeply to them, on a regular basis, and over an extended period, and their joint creativity shapes the world around them in a way that is persistent, a virtual world can come to feel as meaningful and real as a physical space.

It is my strong belief that this process can’t be short-circuited, can’t be rushed and can’t be faked in the same way a complex ecosystem like a forest can’t be faked. Virtual worlds can be real, but it isn’t automatic. If you want to build a virtual world that is a real place, do it slowly, with genuine intent and a respect for the capacity of the creative expression of individuals to shape their environment.

## 2. Celebrate Purposelessness

> A long time ago a carpenter was travelling between cities, when he came across an oak tree which was so vast that a thousand people could stand underneath it. A boat could be carved from each of its major branches. Masses of people came to see it, giving the place a carnival atmosphere. But the carpenter didn’t even look at the tree, he just went on his way. His assistant was shocked, and said to his master “Why did you not even glance at it nor stop, I have never seen such a great tree!”

> The master said “This tree is useless, make a boat from it and it would sink; make a coffin and it would rot quickly; make some furniture and it would fall to pieces. This wood is useless and good for nothing. This is why it has lived so long”

> That night the tree appeared to the master carpenter in a dream, saying “what are you comparing to me, calling me useless? A fruit tree? They have only their usefulness to blame for their destruction by people, I on the other hand have spent a long time studying to be useless; I have nearly perfected it, and this uselessness is very useful to me! If I had been of use, how could I have grown so vast? Somebody would have cut me down hundreds of years ago for my wood”

> When the carpenter awoke and told his assistant about his dream, the assistant said “if that tree wants to be useless, why is it used as the shrine for the spirits of the land? There are constant crowds around it, isn’t that called being useful?”

> “Hush! Don’t say another word!” said the master “The tree happens to be here so it is an altar. By this it protects itself from harm from those who do not realise it is useless, for were it not an altar, it would run the risk of of being chopped down” 

That’s a story from Chuang Tzu, I don’t know a better way of saying it.

A virtual world in which everyone knows exactly why they are there, and every detail has a clear purpose, is a dead place with as much soul as a car park or a vending machine. To breathe life into a virtual world, celebrate purposelessness. Recognise that some ends can only be approached obliquely and over long periods of time.

## Why Roblox?

Roblox is a utility platform for large-scale 3D social environments (see [Baszucki keynote](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G00GlCJc0mU) and their [SEC S-1 filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1315098/000119312520298230/d87104ds1.htm)). We chose Roblox because of its massive user base and accessibility on a wide array of platforms (43 million daily active users as of early 2021) and user-friendly tooling supported by many tutorials (Roblox Studio). It's remarkable that you can deploy an attractive 3D world with 100 simultaneous multiplayer users for free, in minutes, from your laptop. While you can make ugly things with Roblox, you can make [beautiful](https://www.roblox.com/games/3158922185/Toyokawa-Inari-Shrine-Showcase) [things](https://www.roblox.com/games/7056870928/Ancient-Machine-SHOWCASE) [too](https://www.roblox.com/games/6524322789/Garden-Of-Hestia-SHOWCASE).

## Not a University 

Metauni is not a University, and is not aiming to become one.

Universities are large bureaucratic solutions to a set of problems of how to coordinate lecturers, students, knowledge, research, certification of job readiness and physical infrastructure. Some of these, like certification of job readiness and physical infrastructure, metauni is not concerned with at all. For the remaining items, our observation is that new technology, particularly the Internet maturing enough to support vibrant virtual worlds full of people and artificial intelligence, has allowed for these coordination problems to be solved in a new and better way. Metauni is a contraction mapping iterating towards one of the fixed points in this new space.

## Seminar-first

Metauni is a seminar-first institution. Seminars are live social events, where a small group of people work towards understanding a topic. They are about a personal journey, which unfolds over years.

## Video is overrated

In Zoom the feeling of co-presence is based on being able to see other people's faces. This is better than lecturing to a blank screen, but it is also [exhausting](https://psycnet.apa.org/fulltext/2021-77825-003.pdf). In a 3D environment you get a sense of other people paying attention to what is going on, without having to constantly see their faces and your own.

## Not always free

Seminars will always be free, because they are our gift to each other. We expect to be releasing most of our infrastructure (such as [metaboard](https://github.com/metauni/metaboard)) as open source, but eventually some of it may not be publicly released. We expect to be offering paid short classes sometime in 2023.

## Historical influences

Metauni is inspired by the [Free University of Berlin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_University_of_Berlin), [Lianda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Southwestern_Associated_University) and [Sabishii University](https://www.kimstanleyrobinson.info/content/shabishii).
