    Some high level principles and guidelines
---

Metauni is a new institution of higher learning, founded in early 2021. This is a working document which aims to explain what is going on here.

## Guiding principles

1. Virtual Is Real
2. Celebrate Purposelessness
3. Beauty Is Infrastructure
4. In Wildness

## Not a University 

Metauni is not a University, and is not aiming to become one.

Universities are large bureaucratic solutions to a set of problems of how to coordinate lecturers, students, knowledge, research, certification of job readiness and physical infrastructure. Some of these, like certification of job readiness and physical infrastructure, metauni is not concerned with at all. For the remaining items, our observation is that new technology, particularly the Internet maturing enough to support vibrant virtual worlds full of people and artificial intelligence, has allowed for these coordination problems to be solved in a new and better way. Metauni is a contraction mapping iterating towards one of the fixed points in this new space.

## Seminar-first

Metauni is a seminar-first institution. Seminars are live social events, where a small group of people work towards understanding a topic. They are about a personal journey, which unfolds over years.

## Not always free

Seminars will always be free, because they are our gift to each other. We expect to be releasing most of our infrastructure (such as [metaboard](https://github.com/metauni/metaboard)) as open source. We expect to be offering paid short classes sometime in 2023.
