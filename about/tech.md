    How it works

This page is a series of videos with short descriptions, intended as a bare-bones guide to the tech underlying metauni. For more instructions on particupating at metauni, see the [instructions](https://metauni.org/posts/instructions/instructions) page.

# Boards

For the code see the [Metaboard GitHub repo](https://github.com/metauni/metaboard).

## Boards and the web

Each board at metauni has a URL. Think of it like a Zoom meeting URL: when you visit the board URL in a web-browser, you can click on the "Visit Board" link to launch Roblox with the information required to take you directly to the board inside metauni. You can also view a board as a PNG.

# Orbs

Orbs make it easy to attend a seminar at metauni, by making it *optional* to control your avatar in 3D while listening to a talk. When you join an event, walk up to the orb, "Attach as Listener" and you'll hear from the position of the Orb (which is near the speaker) and have the option to engage "Orbcam" which gives you a fullscreen view of the boards. Disable Orbcam to move your avatar around and "Detach" at the end of the talk so you can listen from the position of your avatar again.

A white ring above your head means you are currently attached as a Listener (*note*: if you are far from an Orb, and can't hear someone speaking next to you, this might be why, as your "Metaverse ears" are somewhere else) and a black ring means someone is viewing through Orbcam.

For the code see the [Orb GitHub repo](https://github.com/metauni/orb).
