## Collecting prizes

To collect your prize, you "buy" it from one of the Metauni administrator accounts using Robux provided in a Roblox gift card (believe it or not this seems to be the simplest way to transfer an item). If you won a challenge, email <admin@metauni.org> with your Roblox username and you will receive an email with a Roblox gift card and a link to the prize. Click the "View my digital gift card" link in the email, copy the digital gift card number to your clipboard. Click on the link to redeem on Roblox. Then click the link provided in your email to Buy the prize with the provided Robux.
