# Instructions

## Setup

Metauni uses [Roblox](https://www.roblox.com/) for the 3D virtual environment with voice chat and [Discord](https://www.discord.com) for community discussion and organisation. Roblox is necessary, Discord is optional (but fun!). Both applications can be used on PC, Mac, iOS and Android. To set up spatial voice, Roblox's voice chat, you will need 5-10 minutes and a photo ID showing that you are at least 13 years old.

We recommend that you open the links in each step in a separate tab, so that you can refer back to these instructions:

1. Create a [Roblox](https://www.roblox.com/) account.
2. Complete *Age verification* on the [Settings](https://www.roblox.com/my/account#!/info) page (under your Birthday).
3. Toggle *Enable voice chat* to *On* on the [Privacy](https://www.roblox.com/my/account#!/privacy) page.
4. Enter the [metauni Hub](https://www.roblox.com/games/8165000775/metauni-Hub). Once you click "Play" you will see a prompt to "Download and Install Roblox" which you can ignore if you have already installed the game: wait and the Roblox application should be launched.

That's it! Thanks for taking part in metauni.

## The basics

Roblox is a 3D game environment in which you move your character with the arrows keys or `W, A, S, D`, jump with `Spacebar`, and look around by holding down the right mouse down or doing a two-finger drag on a trackpad. You can click your mouse or tap your trackpad to interact with interface elements in the world (such as the whiteboards). The controls can be changed in `Settings` accessible by pressing `Escape` or clicking on the Roblox icon in the top left hand corner of your screen.

* Roblox voice chat (spatial voice) is *positional*, which means that you only hear people when you are close to them and the volume fades to nothing as you move away. You can see who is speaking by looking for a green coloured microphone icon above their head.

* When you join a game, including when you are teleported to a new place by a portal in the [metauni Hub](https://www.roblox.com/games/8165000775/metauni-Hub), your voice chat will be muted. You will need to click the microphone icon above your head to unmute.

## Discord setup

The installation of Discord is optional but recommended:

1. Create a [Discord](https://www.discord.com) account.
2. Join the [Rising Sea Discord](https://discord.gg/9yBaAxPSK8), the official Discord server for metauni. If that link doesn't work properly for you, open Discord, click the large Plus "Add Server" button on on the left hand side, click "Join a Server" and paste `https://discord.gg/9yBaAxPSK8` into the textbox.

## More on spatial voice

The official instructions are [here](https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/4405807645972-Spatial-Voice-). Roblox says that they never store "raw ID document data" but in order to verify your age, they send the picture of the government-issued ID that you upload to a third-party company called Veriff ([FAQ](https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/4407276151188-Age-ID-Verification-FAQs)). They say in the FAQ that "Information uploaded to Veriff is retained for a period of 90 days. After this period, the uploaded data is removed from Veriff." 

It is worth reading Veriff's [privacy policy](https://www.veriff.com/privacy-policy).

> A human will be involved if the automated verification tool (the Robot) is not able to reach a decision on its own. This may occur, when the picture is blurry or the Robot runs into some other difficulty in analysing the verification session.. In the case of fully automated decision-making, where the decision has a significant effect on you, we will be transparent about such processing.

## Helpful hints



* To interact with in-world GUI elements, such as buttons, you simply (left) click on them. Most of the white floating displays can be clicked on for a more readable popup view, including the presenter display in the talk zone.

* To use the in-game chat press `/`. It's convenient to quickly toggle between fullscreen and windowed, which is `fn + F11` on a Mac, but you'll have to first disable the "Show Desktop" shortcut in System Preferences.

* You can access animations, such as waves, by pressing `.`. You can enable additional animations on the Roblox website.

You should comply with the [Roblox rules](http://metauni.org/posts/rules/rules) while on their platform, and that includes the developer rules if you are creating your own nodes. These rules are in place to protect the children who spend a lot of time in Roblox, and seem to me well-intentioned and reasonable. However this does mean that you should **refrain from using the in-game chat or images to share URLs** or post Discord information inside your node. This coordination should happen on Discord or through some other channel. Finally, *do not under any circumstances climb the knot*.

## Presenter tips

To write on a metaboard we recommend using a tablet. You'll have to run Roblox on that tablet, and as this can consume battery life quite rapidly, you probably want to have your tablet plugged into power during the talk.

## Troubleshooting

* If you have trouble connecting to Roblox (and you have clicked Retry a few times) you might have to turn off your VPN.
* You may have problems using Firefox on the Roblox site.
* If your mouse gets locked try zooming all the way in with `I` and then out with `O`.
* When drawing on the whiteboards you might want to turn off the in-game chat by clicking on its icon.
