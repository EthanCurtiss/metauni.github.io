# Video

On this page you can find information about how the videos in the metauni [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJTk6uSbSsclXN8v3b27_QQ) are created. One advantage of virtual lectures over in-person lectures is that they are (generally) more convenient to record at high quality, especially if speakers make use of cheaply available, [highly quality microphones](https://metauni.org/posts/instructions/hardware). As of this writing (September 2022) we have recorded over 200 hours of seminars and lectures.

## Workflow

The workflow for recording a seminar (not as speaker) are as follows:

0. **Prep**. Make sure you have enough disk space to record (somewhere between 20-30Gb per hour, depending on your settings, to record both your local audio and system audio and screen), microphones and devices are plugged into power, etc.
1. **Recording**. Make sure to record both the microphone on the local machine (for your voice), system audio (which is what will capture the voice of the speaker coming through Roblox voice chat or Discord) and the screen. It's a good idea to test your settings before recording a live seminar. Join Roblox and attach as Listener to the relevant Orb, and get into Orbcam.
2. **Editing**: most of the time in preparing videos lies in the editing process, and most of this lies in editing out background audio of your own voice track (which is not audible to others during the event, if you're muted). Generally it takes me somewhere from 3-6min per 1hr of video to process.
3. **Uploading**
4. **Processing**: adding titles and descriptions, choosing a thumbnail and playlists. While YouTube autograbs potential thumbnails (and does a surprisingly good job) you will probably want to upload higher quality screenshots. Tag the videos in the description with the recording date (which is generally going to be different to the upload date) to maintain sanity later.

## Tools

The tools used to make our recordings as of September 2022:

* [Camtasia](https://www.techsmith.com/video-editor.html) for video and audio recording and editing. While [OBS](https://obsproject.com) is free and capable, note that (at least on Mac OS X) there are some steps required to reliably record System Audio.
* [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/home). Note that 20-30Gb per hour adds up to a lot of storage, if you have 4-5 seminars to record once a week.
* [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com). You may prefer options like [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com) but note that if you are planning to upload at the rate that metauni does, you will be paying a substantial amount per year to be on their business plans. YouTube has its downsides, but its advantages are also profound: it is free, and has enormous reach. I just upload through the web interface and use no additional tools beyond the built-in YouTube Studio.

For one hour seminars the final MP4 file is somewhere around 5-10Gb.

## Notes

In the early days quite a few seminar recordings were lost (a crime!), principally due to

* Running out of disk space (solution: *be rigorous about uploading old seminars to Dropbox or external storage well before new recording dates*).
* Failing to capture system audio (solution: *double check after system upgrades or Camtasia upgrades, as the system audio plugins may stop working*).

Some notes:

* It's better to process videos as soon as possible after recording, because you will want to fill in detailed descriptions while your memory of the seminar is fresh. **Use good thumbnails**.

* Take pictures to post in Discord

* YouTube as principal funnel

* Our videos all link to metauni itself, and the webpage for the particular seminar. YouTube and Google Search (which prioritises YouTube videos to a degree you may underestimate) will be one of the principal ways in which you attract people to your seminars, make sure it is easy for people to find you once they notice your video.
