# Video

On this page you can find information about how the videos in the metauni [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJTk6uSbSsclXN8v3b27_QQ) are created. One advantage of virtual lectures over in-person lectures is that they are (generally) more convenient to record at high quality, especially if speakers make use of cheaply available, [highly quality microphones](https://metauni.org/posts/instructions/hardware). As of this writing (September 2022) we have recorded over 200 hours of seminars and lectures at metauni.

## Workflow

The workflow for recording a seminar (not as speaker) are as follows:

0. **Prep**. Make sure you have enough disk space to record (somewhere between 20-30Gb per hour, depending on your settings, to record both your local audio and system audio and screen).
1. **Start recording**. Make sure to record both the microphone on the local machine (for your voice), system audio (which is what will capture the voice of the speaker coming through Roblox voice chat or Discord) and the screen. It's a good idea to test your settings before recording a live seminar.
2. **Join Roblox**. Attach as Listener to the relevant Orb, and get into Orbcam.
3. **Stop recording**. 
4. **Editing**: most of the time in preparing videos lies in the editing process, and most of this lies in editing out background audio of your own voice track (which is not audible to others during the event, if you're muted). Generally it takes me somewhere from 3-6min per 1hr of video to process.

Main problems:

* Running out of disk space.
* Failing to capture system audio.
* Notes for future editing

## Tools

The tools used to make our recordings as of September 2022:

* [Camtasia](https://www.techsmith.com/video-editor.html) for video and audio recording and editing. While [OBS](https://obsproject.com) is free and capable, note that (at least on Mac OS X) there are some steps required to reliably record System Audio.
* [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/home). Note that 20-30Gb per hour adds up to a lot of storage, if you have 4-5 seminars to record once a week.
* YouTube

For one hour seminars the final MP4 file is somewhere around 5-10Gb,
