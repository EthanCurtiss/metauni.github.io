# Instructions for speakers and admins

First you should follow the [normal instructions](instructions) to install and setup Roblox and spatial voice.

## Speakers

Thanks for giving a talk! And for your patience with the rough edges. Here's our guide for speakers:

* **Attach as Speaker**: you can find a brief description of the orb system in the [instructions](instructions). As a speaker you will have `scribe` permissions, which means that you can walk up to an orb and activate the proximity prompt to "attach as speaker" (hold `F` for a few seconds or click/tap on the popup). You should hear a sound and see the GUI on the left-hand side of your screen. Now the orb will follow you from board to board. Since the audience may choose to listen and see from the orb, when you move to a new board **please wait for the orb** before you continue speaking (it may be a few seconds behind you, and will only begin to move once you **stop** moving at your destination).

Some advice:

* **Lower graphics quality for battery life**: If you are using an iPad to present in metauni, we highly recommend setting *Graphics Quality* to its minimum setting. At high settings Roblox will rapidly consume your device's battery. On the minimum setting I get approximately `3.3 hours` of battery life on a `iPad Pro 12.9inch 2nd gen`.

## Admins

Here is the checklist we follow before metauni events:

* Speakers have been sent the above instructions.
* Speakers have the appropriate `scribe` permission (e.g. by typing `/setscribe username` in the server).
* Boards are off for guests.
* Discord events have been created for all sessions.

## Recording

Here is my checklist for recording:

* Test audio
* Keepalive script
