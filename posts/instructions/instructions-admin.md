# Instructions for speakers and admins

First you should follow the [normal instructions](instructions) to install and setup Roblox and spatial voice.

## Speakers

* **Lower graphics quality for battery life**: If you are using an iPad to present in metauni, we highly recommend setting *Graphics Quality* to its minimum setting. At high settings Roblox will rapidly consume your device's battery. On the minimum setting I get approximately `3.3 hours` of battery life on a `iPad Pro 12.9inch 2nd gen`.

* **Zoom in, then board**: If you are using Roblox voice chat on the same device you are using to write on the boards (e.g. an iPad) we recommend zooming all the way into first person view (i.e. "into your head") by using pinch-to-zoom before you click on the board. At the moment there is a bug with Roblox's spatial voice, which means that writing on the board can inadvertently **click the mute icon** above your head, muting you mid-talk. Until this bug is fixed, the workaround is to zoom in.
