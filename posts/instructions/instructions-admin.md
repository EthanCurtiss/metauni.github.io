# Instructions for speakers

These instructions aim to be a detailed guide to giving a successful talk in metauni. First you should follow the [normal instructions](instructions) to install and setup Roblox and spatial voice.

## Hardware

If you are giving a board talk we recommend running Roblox on an iPad with Pencil (or equivalent tablet and stylus) with any of the following audio-visual setups:

1. Headphones with in-built microphone plugged into the `3.5mm` jack.
2. Headphones with in-built microphone plugged into the Lightning plug.
3. The built-in speaker and microphone (i.e. no headphones).

We've had speakers successfully give talks with all three setups, but perhaps among them (1) is optimal because it allows you to plug your iPad into a power outlet if the battery gets low during your talk. On that note:

* **Lower graphics quality for battery life**: If you are using an iPad to present in metauni, we highly recommend setting *Graphics Quality* to its minimum setting. At high settings Roblox will rapidly consume your device's battery. On the minimum setting I get approximately `3.3 hours` of battery life on a `iPad Pro 12.9inch 2nd gen`.

If you are presenting using slides, then you can join Roblox with any setup that supports spatial voice (e.g. your laptop with headphones).

* **Question: what about Wacom tablets?** People have successfully used Wacom tablets to write on metaboards, but we have not extensively tested this.

### Importance of a good microphone

You can greatly enhance the experience of your audience by going the extra mile with microphone quality. This can take a talk from “good-enough/intelligible” to “pleasant to listen to for an hour or more”. The easiest improvement you can make is getting a USB microphone in your price range, and having it as close to your mouth as possible. 

A cheaper microphone closer to your mouth will sound better than an expensive one sitting at the end of your desk. A shorter distance increases the volume ratio between your voice and the background noise, so the microphone can be at a lower sensitivity, which cuts the room noise (as opposed to high sensitivity when your speaking far away from the mic). This sensitivity is called "gain" and most USB mics will have a dial to adjust this. The exception to this distance rule is when the microphone is too tiny and becomes overpowered by your voice (and so distorts). This happens with earbud mics. For more detail on microphone positioning see [this video](https://youtu.be/fFzwTcNAUYY).

The downside with microphones that stand on your desk is that they can be a bit inconvenient while writing on a tablet, because the best position for them will prevent you from putting the tablet in a comfortable writing position. The least obtrusive option would be a lavalier mic that clips onto your shirt. It will be nice and close to your mouth while you’re looking down and is completely out of the way. Another solution if you’re really keen on having a nice setup is getting a microphone boom stand that attaches to your desk, which holds your microphone up to your face, and you can easily position it or move it out of the way when you’re not using it.

Some mics that are recommended by our community:

- Samson SAGOMIC USB mic ($40) ([link](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001R76D42?th=1))
- Blue Yeti USB mic ($200) ([link](https://www.bluemic.com/en-au/products/yeti/))

## Joining the event

The organiser should provide you with the URL of the Roblox world for your talk. If you are speaking in a recurring seminar, you can find the URL on the webpage for  that seminar (see the [metauni homepage](https://metauni.org)). Once you have the URL:

1. We recommend joining the event **five minutes early**, since Roblox may need to upgrade and you may need to check that spatial voice is working correctly with your setup.
2. Once you have joined, make your way to the in-world location of your talk (an organiser will have hopefully helped you figure this out beforehand).
3. Locate the Orb for your talk and **Attach as Speaker**. You can find a brief description of the orb system in the [instructions](instructions). To attach as speaker approach an orb, and stand close enough to the proximity prompts to appear; then hold `F` for a few seconds or click/tap on the popup. You should hear a sound and see the speaker GUI on the left-hand side of your screen. 
4. Please wait for the session organiser to confirm that the recording is working, and invite you to begin your talk.
5. Use the navigation controls (`W, A, S, D` on a keyboard, tap and drag near the bottom left of an iPad) to keep your player near the board you are writing on. This is how the orb knows what board you are writing on; note that whichever board the orb is nearest is the board that players using OrbCam will see. 
6. When you want to move to a new board, simply move your player to the new board, stop running, and then wait a few moments for the orb (and the view of players using OrbCam) to join you at the new board. In the interim catch your breath - if you speak, audiences listening through the orb may be unable to hear you until it gets back within hearing range.
7. When your talk is over, click the red and white "X" in the speaker GUI on the left-hand side of your screen to detach from the orb (this way the orb will not continue to follow you around).

If you feel uncomfortable managing the orb, please ask the session organiser if they can take care of it for you.

## Admins

Here is the checklist we follow before metauni events:

* Speakers have been sent the above instructions.
* Speakers have the appropriate `scribe` permission (e.g. by typing `/setscribe username` in the server).
* Boards are off for guests.
* Discord events have been created for all sessions.

## Recording

Here is my checklist for recording:

* Plug in headphones
* Start recording software (e.g. Camtasia)
* Start Roblox and join the experience
* Start the keepalive script
* Test audio (joining with another account with spatial voice enabled, speak near the recording player account)
* Put the recording player into GUI-less orbcam with `Shift-C`
