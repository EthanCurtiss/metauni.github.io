At metauni learning is centered on virtual blackboards that we call *metaboards*. It is therefore recommended that you have access to a tablet with stylus, in order to collaborate on the metaboards with other students. Tablets that plug into your computer via USB can be found for as little as AUD$50. Members of our community have successfully used the following products:
