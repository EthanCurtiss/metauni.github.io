The festival will run from **10am-3pm** Melbourne time (so from 5pm Los Angeles). All but the first speaker are present or former graduate students at the University of Melbourne (quality!).

The venue is a virtual space created in Roblox, [LC002](https://www.roblox.com/games/7168699181/metauni-LC002-Research-Agora) (the Research Agora), which is used for 3D interaction and virtual blackboards and slides. The event audio is via the [TRS Discord](https://discord.gg/9yBaAxPSK8) in voice channel `LC002`. To join you need to create a Roblox account and install Discord,  see the [instructions](https://metauni.org/posts/instructions/instructions). If you want the experience to work correctly, you should also register your Roblox username in Discord as detailed in the instructions (this allows Discord to transition you automatically between location-specific voice channels).

The schedule:

- **10:00-10:30** Daniel Murfet, *The mathematics of AlphaGo, AlphaStar, AlphaFold*.
- **10:30-11:00** Ben Gerraty, *Conformal blocks in the minimal models*.
- **11:00-11:30** Will Troiani, *Quantum error correcting codes*.
- **11:30-12:00** Spencer Wong, *Feedforward networks are polynomial*.
- **12:00-13:00** Lunch / Spectrum Spat
- **13:00-13:30** Liam Carroll, *Phase transitions in deep learning*.
- **13:30-14:00** Tom Waring, *Program synthesis and learning theory*.
- **14:00-14:30** Eleanor McMurtry, *Composable models of computation*.
- **14:30-15:00** Isaac Smith, *Comments on (the Mathematics of) Producing Twisted Quantum Doubles*.
