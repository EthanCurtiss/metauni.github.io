# Festival of Mathematics

The festival will run from **10am-3pm** Melbourne time (so from 5pm Los Angeles). The venue is a virtual space created in Roblox, [LC002](https://www.roblox.com/games/7168699181/metauni-LC002-Research-Agora) (the Research Agora), which is used for 3D interaction and virtual blackboards and slides. The event audio is via the [TRS Discord](https://discord.gg/9yBaAxPSK8) in voice channel `LC002`. To join you need to create a Roblox account and install Discord,  see the [instructions](https://metauni.org/posts/instructions/instructions). If you want the experience to work correctly, you should also register your Roblox username in Discord as detailed in the instructions (this allows Discord to transition you automatically between location-specific voice channels).

- **10:00-10:30** Daniel Murfet, *The mathematics of AlphaGo, AlphaStar, AlphaFold*.
- **10:30-11:00** Ben Gerraty, *Conformal blocks in the minimal models*.
