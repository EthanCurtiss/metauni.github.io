# Running a metauni node

After following the [guide](http://metauni.org/posts/make-your-own/make-your-own) to setup your own metauni node, the next question is: what do you do with it? On this page we explain how to reproduce the tools you see in our event videos for the Rising Sea node, and other aspects of enabling intellectual activities in a metauni node.

## metauni tools

We use the Rising Sea node and events therein to prototype useful objects, such as whiteboards and Weiqi boards, which are eventually released for free on the Roblox Toolbox for other people to use in their own nodes. To find them in Roblox Studio just open up the Toolbox and search for "metauni". The currently available objects:

* [metauni Weiqi board](https://www.roblox.com/library/6366028251/metauni-Weiqi-Go-board). This game board has a persistent state that survives across server restarts and supports undo. For a good time try it with an iPad!
* [metauni Whiteboard](https://www.roblox.com/library/6376883627/metauni-Whiteboard). Multi-user whiteboard with undo. Use it with an iPad for extra joy.
* [metauni Viewer](https://www.roblox.com/library/6377010705/metauni-Viewer). Upload PNGs using Asset Manager, create Decals and put them in `Gui > Images` in order to put content into your world (e.g. papers).
