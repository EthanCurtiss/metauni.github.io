# Private servers

In the course of running seminars and [events](https://metauni.org/posts/events/events) in Roblox since the beginning of 2021 we have learned a lot about how to support intellectual activities in virtual spaces. Most of the code that we have developed to faciliate these activities has already been open sourced, including:

* Admin commands, Discord bot, viewer available from our [tools page](https://metauni.org/posts/make-your-own/tools).
* Whiteboards have been released, see the [metaboard](https://github.com/metauni/metaboard) repository.

These releases will continue, but we think that some users will prefer a simpler way to create environments similar to the ones in which we host metauni events, which will **just work**. To this end we are starting to explore the use of Roblox [Private Servers](https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/205345050-How-do-I-Purchase-and-Configure-Private-VIP-Servers-).

Private servers are copies of a server that are owned by individuals, in the sense that they control who joins them and their copy can have its own URL. We will be creating versions of the metauni experiences with private servers enabled, so that your own copy of the server comes with the following features automatically set up:

- Whiteboards
- Admin commands (kick, ban, fine-grained control over use of whiteboards)
- Voice chat (built into Roblox)
- Event management
- Minigames / toys

We believe the best environments for scholarly life will be collaborations between coders, musicians, visual artists, architects and domain experts (e.g. mathematicians) and we look forward to helping to create such environments over the coming year, as private servers.

These plans are still in their early stages, but here are

- "[Proof of Concept](https://www.roblox.com/games/8276085305/Proof-of-Concept)" a world constructed by freezing Songspires and putting boards in it, with private servers and voice chat enabled. The owner of the private server (you?) is an admin.
