# Private Servers

Want to run your own metauni-style events? Our tools are [open source](https://metauni.org/posts/make-your-own/tools), so you can build your own [from scratch](https://metauni.org/posts/make-your-own/make-your-own). However, the easiest way to run events is to rent a [Private Server](https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/205345050-How-do-I-Purchase-and-Configure-Private-VIP-Servers-). These are private copies of a server which you control; for example, you can control the list of people who can join, and you can advertise your event using your own URL. Private servers come with the following features ``out of the box'':

- Whiteboards
- Admin commands (kick, ban, fine-grained control over use of whiteboards)
- Voice chat (built into Roblox)
- Minigames / toys

It is the manifestation of the creative will of others which draws us out of our shells, and creates the possibility for the social interaction that makes experiences like metauni more than just Zoom calls in 3D. We believe that the best environments for scholarly life in the Metaverse will be collaborations between coders, musicians, visual artists, garden designers and domain experts (e.g. mathematicians).

## Available servers

The private servers currently available:

- [Iteration of Concept](https://www.roblox.com/games/8278496526/Iteration-of-Concept) with working boards, Admin commands, and Coin Run challenge in an environment built from a snapshot of Songspire ([making of](https://youtu.be/l_Fl6tKZvQQ)).

## Instructions

On the Roblox page for one of the private servers (e.g. [Iteration of Concept](https://www.roblox.com/games/8278496526/Iteration-of-Concept)) click on the `Server` and `Create Private Server`. You can find your private server by either navigating to the Roblox page for the game and returning to the `Server` tab, or under `Inventory > Private Servers` (see the left hand side of the Roblox homepage, under the hamburger menu). The Inventory is also where you can cancel your subscription to the private server (which auto-renews monthly).

When you are ready to run your event, click `Join` under Private Servers (if you join the non-private version of the experience, you will still be able to enter the world but you will not be able to control it).

* **Admin commands**: when you join your private server type `/helpadmin` in the Chat to get instructions on using the Admin Commands. You can see further details [here](https://metauni.org/posts/make-your-own/tools).
* **Recording events**: you can activate the free camera with `Left Shift-P`, position the camera to view what you want to record, and then record your screen using software such as [Camtasia](https://www.techsmith.com/video-editor.html).

## Future roadmap

We hope to implement the following features in private servers:

- Event management (such as the What's On boards in the metauni Hub)
- Automated video recording for talks (via bots running in the cloud)
- Assistance for uploading slides into Roblox
- Signing up for classes/tutorials and scheduling
