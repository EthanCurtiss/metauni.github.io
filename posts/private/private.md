# Private Servers

Want to run your own metauni-style events? Our tools are [open source](https://metauni.org/posts/make-your-own/tools), so you can build your own experiences. However, the easiest way to run events is to rent a [Private Server](https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/205345050-How-do-I-Purchase-and-Configure-Private-VIP-Servers-). These are private copies of a server which you control; for example, you can control the list of people who can join, and you can advertise your event using your own URL. Private servers come with the following features ``out of the box'':

- Whiteboards
- Admin commands (kick, ban, fine-grained control over use of whiteboards)
- Voice chat (built into Roblox)
- Event management
- Minigames / toys

The private servers currently available:

- [Iteration of Concept](https://www.roblox.com/games/8278496526/Iteration-of-Concept) with working boards, Admin commands, and coin run challenge in an environment built from a snapshot of Songspire ([making of](https://youtu.be/l_Fl6tKZvQQ)).
- [Proof of Concept](https://www.roblox.com/games/8276085305/Proof-of-Concept) rough prototype ([making of](https://youtu.be/pB44fI0lKso)).

It is the manifestation of the creative will of others which draws us out of our shells, and creates the possibility for the social interaction that makes experiences like metauni more than just Zoom calls in 3D. We believe that the best environments for scholarly life in the Metaverse will be collaborations between coders, musicians, visual artists, garden designers and domain experts (e.g. mathematicians).
