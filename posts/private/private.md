# Private Servers

*Beta*

It is the manifestation of the creative will of others which draws us out of our shells, and creates the possibility for the social interaction that makes experiences like metauni more than just Zoom calls in 3D. We believe that the best environments for scholarly life in the Metaverse will be collaborations between coders, musicians, visual artists, garden designers, architects and domain experts (e.g. mathematicians). In the course of running seminars and [events](https://metauni.org/posts/events/events) in Roblox since the beginning of 2021 we have learned how to support intellectual activities in virtual spaces. Some of the products of that learning have been open sourced, including:

* Admin commands, Discord bot, viewer available from our [tools page](https://metauni.org/posts/make-your-own/tools).
* Whiteboards, see the [metaboard](https://github.com/metauni/metaboard) repository.

These open source releases will continue. However, some users will find value in a simpler way to host metauni-style events, that they can trust will **just work**. To this end we are starting to explore the use of Roblox [Private Servers](https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/205345050-How-do-I-Purchase-and-Configure-Private-VIP-Servers-).

Private servers are private copies of a server, which are *owned by a user* in the sense that the user can control who joins. Private servers have their own URL. We will be creating versions of some metauni experiences with private servers enabled, so that your copy of the server comes with the following features automatically set up:

- Whiteboards
- Admin commands (kick, ban, fine-grained control over use of whiteboards)
- Voice chat (built into Roblox)
- Event management
- Minigames / toys

However metauni is more than just the sum of these parts, and we look forward in 2022 to creating some of these private servers in collaboration with talented musicians and artists. These plans are still in their early stages, but here are some rough prototypes:

- [Proof of Concept](https://www.roblox.com/games/8276085305/Proof-of-Concept) ([making of](https://youtu.be/pB44fI0lKso)).
- [Iteration of Concept](https://www.roblox.com/games/8278496526/Iteration-of-Concept) with working boards, Admin commands, and coin run challenge in an environment built from a snapshot of Songspire ([making of](https://youtu.be/l_Fl6tKZvQQ)).
