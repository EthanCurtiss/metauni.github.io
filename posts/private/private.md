# Private Servers

Want to run your own metauni-style events? Our tools are [open source](https://metauni.org/posts/make-your-own/tools), so you can build your own experiences. However, the easiest way to run events is to rent a [Private Server](https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/205345050-How-do-I-Purchase-and-Configure-Private-VIP-Servers-). These are private copies of a server which you control; for example, you can control the list of people who can join, you can use the Admin Commands (`kick, ban, board control, ...`), you can begin and end challenges, and so on. Private servers come with the following features ``out of the box'':

- Whiteboards
- Admin commands (kick, ban, fine-grained control over use of whiteboards)
- Voice chat (built into Roblox)
- Event management
- Minigames / toys

## Currently available

- [Iteration of Concept](https://www.roblox.com/games/8278496526/Iteration-of-Concept) with working boards, Admin commands, and coin run challenge in an environment built from a snapshot of Songspire ([making of](https://youtu.be/l_Fl6tKZvQQ)).

It is the manifestation of the creative will of others which draws us out of our shells, and creates the possibility for the social interaction that makes experiences like metauni more than just Zoom calls in 3D. We believe that the best environments for scholarly life in the Metaverse will be collaborations between coders, musicians, visual artists, garden designers and domain experts (e.g. mathematicians). In the course of running seminars and [events](https://metauni.org/posts/events/events) in Roblox since the beginning of 2021 we have learned how to support intellectual activities in virtual spaces. Some of the products of that learning have been open sourced, including:

* Admin commands, Discord bot, viewer available from our [tools page]().
* Whiteboards, see the [metaboard](https://github.com/metauni/metaboard) repository.

These open source releases will continue. However, some users will find value in a simpler way to host metauni-style events, that they can trust will **just work**. To this end we are starting to explore the use of Roblox 



However metauni is more than just the sum of these parts, and we look forward in 2022 to creating some of these private servers in collaboration with talented musicians and artists. These plans are still in their early stages, but here are some rough prototypes:
