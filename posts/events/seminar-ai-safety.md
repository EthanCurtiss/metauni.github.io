AI safety reading group
=======================

Weekly discussions of readings on technical and philosophical topics in
AI safety.

AI Safety is the field trying to figure out how to stop AI systems from
breaking the world, and in particular, trying to do so before they break
the world.
Readings will mostly focus on potential issues arising from future advanced
AI systems, and may also touch on present-day issues.
