# Landau-Ginzburg

On the geometry and (bi)category theory of isolated hypersurface singularities. Thursdays `21:00-22:00 AEDT`.

The aim of the seminar is to provide an accessible and detailed construction of the bicategory of Landau-Ginzburg models (which has isolated hypersurface singularities as objects and matrix factorisations as 1-morphisms). Partly this is meant as background for work on semantics of linear logic involving this structure. You might the talking boards in [LC001](https://www.roblox.com/games/6461013759/Landau-Ginzburg) useful.
