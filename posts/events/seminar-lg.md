# Landau-Ginzburg

On matrix factorisations and the bicategory of Landau-Ginzburg models. Thursdays `21:00-22:00 AEDT`.

The aim of the seminar is to provide an accessible and detailed construction of the bicategory of Landau-Ginzburg models (which has isolated hypersurface singularities as objects and matrix factorisations as 1-morphisms). Partly this is meant as background for work on semantics of linear logic involving this structure.
