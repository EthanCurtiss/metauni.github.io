# Euclid

This is the homepage of a community that meets to prepare and deliver lectures on Euclid's *Elements* in a world literally made of triangles. Euclid's text is the wellspring of both geometry and logic, and we are interested in both developments, at levels ranging from the elementary to the advanced. We extend a special invitation to young people and mathematicians outside of academia.

From Hilbert's "[Foundations of geometry](https://math.berkeley.edu/~wodzicki/160/Hilbert.pdf)".

> Geometry, like arithmetic, requires for its logical development only a small number of simple, fundamental principles. These fundamental principles are called the axioms of geometry. The choice of the axioms and the investigation of their relations to one another is a problem which, since the time of Euclid, has been discussed in numerous excellent memoirs to be found in the mathematical literature. This problem is tantamount to the logical analysis of our intuition of space.

Here is an extract from R. Hartshorne's "Geometry: Euclid and Beyond".

> It is for this logical structure, perhaps even more than for its mathematical content, that Euclid's *Elements* is famous. The *axiomatic method* of sequential logical deduction, starting from a small number of initial definitions and assumptions, has become the basic structure of all subsequent mathematics. Euclid's *Elements* is the first great example of this method.
