# Euclid

Nothing could be simpler than the geometry of points and lines, and that is [complex indeed](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/epistemology-geometry/). 

Here is an extract from R. Hartshorne's "Geometry: Euclid and Beyond".

> It is for this logical structure, perhaps even more than for its mathematical content, that Euclid's *Elements* is famous. The *axiomatic method* of sequential logical deduction, starting from a small number of initial definitions and assumptions, has become the basic structure of all subsequent mathematics. Euclid's *Elements* is the first great example of this method. The importance of the axiomatic method in modern times was emphasized at the turn of the century by David Hilbert, whose work we will study later in this book.
