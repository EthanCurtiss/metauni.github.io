# Rules of Roblox

When creating the content for your node it is important to remember that while higher education and corporate usage is on Roblox's roadmap, at the moment they make their money from **kids playing games** and so they have a stringent process for examining uploaded images and audio. To avoid getting your account locked, you should familiarise yourself with:

* Roblox [Terms of Use](https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004647846-Roblox-Terms-of-Use).

* Roblox [Community Rules](https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/203313410-Roblox-Community-Rules).

* The [Moderation Messages](https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020870412-Understanding-Moderation-Messages).

Some relevant passages:

> **Ownership of UGC and License Grant to Roblox.** For any UGC that you have ever Provided or that you will Provide (whether created solely by you or together with others) (a) between you and us or you and users, you retain all copyrights that you may hold in the UGC, and (b) in consideration of using the Service and the potential to earn Robux as discussed in the Robux section, you grant us a perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free right and license (with the right to sublicense to any person or entity, whether a user of the Service or not) to host, store, transfer, publicly display, publicly perform (including by means of digital audio transmissions and on a through-to-the-audience basis), reproduce (including in timed synchronization to visual images), modify, create derivative works of, distribute, and use in any way the UGC that you Provide, in whole or in part, including modifications and derivative works, in any media or formats (tangible or intangible) and through any media, items or channels (online, offline, or others, now known or hereafter developed), including for publicity and marketing purposes (except that you are not granting us any license to make new or derivative video games using your UGC). 

It is likely that from time to time you *will* inadvertently have your account locked for violating their Terms of Use or Community Rules while uploading content in Roblox Studio (we have). When this happens you may be locked out of Roblox Studio. Just go to the Roblox homepage and log into your account, and will see a "Moderation Message" explaining your violation. If you agree to follow the rules in future they unlock your account (which happens instantly in our experience). The messages are listed  along with further explanation of what causes each message. While this is disconcerting there is no reason to panic:

> **I got a warning, am I on the road to deletion?**
> Not likely, Roblox only deletes accounts for the most serious violations or people who are maliciously acting on our community.

However this uncertainty does mean that you should **avoid editing your world immediately prior to an event**. 

Here are some of the rule violations you are likely to encounter in preparing academic content for Roblox:

* Make sure your in-game text and images do not contain **URLs or email addresses** (e.g. the first or last page of preprints). Their AI will catch anything that even remotely looks like either, so "a@b" or "a.b" is risky.
* Do not put information about Discord in-world or instructions for using it
* Photos of people (they are afraid of users identifying other users)
* We have observed that even the word "Talk" on a `SurfaceGui > TextLabel` is enough to cause problems (not Moderation Messages but weird behaviour in Roblox Studio). In general if you observe strange behaviour, think about whether or not you could have introduced something their AIs dislike.
