# Rules of Roblox

When creating the content for your node it is important to remember that while higher education and corporate usage is on Roblox's roadmap, at the moment they make their money from **kids playing games** and so they have a stringent process for examining uploaded images and audio. To avoid getting your account locked, you should familiarise yourself with:

* Roblox [Terms of Use](https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004647846-Roblox-Terms-of-Use).

* Roblox [Community Rules](https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/203313410-Roblox-Community-Rules).

* The [Moderation Messages](https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020870412-Understanding-Moderation-Messages).

It is likely that from time to time you *will* inadvertently have your account locked for violating their Terms of Use or Community Rules while uploading content in Roblox Studio (we have). When this happens you may be locked out of Roblox Studio. Just go to the Roblox homepage and log into your account, and will see a "Moderation Message" explaining your violation. If you agree to follow the rules in future they unlock your account (which happens instantly in our experience). The messages are listed  along with further explanation of what causes each message. While this is disconcerting there is no reason to panic:

> **I got a warning, am I on the road to deletion?**
> Not likely, Roblox only deletes accounts for the most serious violations or people who are maliciously acting on our community.

However this uncertainty does mean that you should **avoid editing your world immediately prior to an event**. 

Here are some of the rule violations you are likely to encounter in preparing academic content for Roblox:

* Make sure your in-game text and images do not contain **URLs or email addresses** (e.g. the first or last page of preprints). Their AI will catch anything that even remotely looks like either, so "a@b" or "a.b" is risky.
* Do not put information about Discord in-world or instructions for using it
* Photos of people (they are afraid of users identifying other users)
* We have observed that even the word "Talk" on a `SurfaceGui > TextLabel` is enough to cause problems (not Moderation Messages but weird behaviour in Roblox Studio). In general if you observe strange behaviour, think about whether or not you could have introduced something their AIs dislike.
