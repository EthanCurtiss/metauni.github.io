# Rules of Roblox

When creating the content for your node it is important to remember that while higher education and corporate usage is on Roblox's roadmap, at the moment they make their money from **kids playing games** and so they have a stringent process for examining uploaded images and audio. To avoid getting your account locked, you should familiarise yourself with:

* Roblox [Terms of Use](https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004647846-Roblox-Terms-of-Use).

* Roblox [Community Rules](https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/203313410-Roblox-Community-Rules).

* The [Moderation Messages](https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020870412-Understanding-Moderation-Messages).

It is likely that from time to time you *will* inadvertently have your account locked for violating their Terms of Use or Community Rules while uploading content in Roblox Studio (we have). When this happens you may be locked out of Roblox Studio. Just go to the Roblox homepage and log into your account, and will see a "Moderation Message" explaining your violation. If you agree to follow the rules in future they unlock your account (which happens instantly in our experience). The messages are listed  along with further explanation of what causes each message. While this is disconcerting there is no reason to panic:

> **I got a warning, am I on the road to deletion?**
> Not likely, Roblox only deletes accounts for the most serious violations or people who are maliciously acting on our community.

However this uncertainty does mean that you should **avoid editing your world immediately prior to an event**. 

Here are some of the rule violations you are likely to encounter in preparing academic content for Roblox:

* Make sure your in-game text and images do not contain **URLs or email addresses** (e.g. the first or last page of preprints). Their AI will catch anything that even remotely looks like either, so "a@b" or "a.b" is risky. However links to YouTube, Twitter, Twitch are explicitly allowed.
* Do not put information about Discord in-world or instructions for using it
* Photos of people (they are afraid of users identifying other users)
* We have observed that even the word "Talk" on a `SurfaceGui > TextLabel` is enough to cause problems (not Moderation Messages but weird behaviour in Roblox Studio). In general if you observe strange behaviour, think about whether or not you could have introduced something their AIs dislike.

## Quotes from the rules

An important passage from the Terms of Use:

> **Ownership of UGC and License Grant to Roblox.** For any UGC that you have ever Provided or that you will Provide (whether created solely by you or together with others) (a) between you and us or you and users, you retain all copyrights that you may hold in the UGC, and (b) in consideration of using the Service and the potential to earn Robux as discussed in the Robux section, you grant us a perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free right and license (with the right to sublicense to any person or entity, whether a user of the Service or not) to host, store, transfer, publicly display, publicly perform (including by means of digital audio transmissions and on a through-to-the-audience basis), reproduce (including in timed synchronization to visual images), modify, create derivative works of, distribute, and use in any way the UGC that you Provide, in whole or in part, including modifications and derivative works, in any media or formats (tangible or intangible) and through any media, items or channels (online, offline, or others, now known or hereafter developed), including for publicity and marketing purposes (except that you are not granting us any license to make new or derivative video games using your UGC). 

Some important passages from the Community Rules:

> **Personal information.** We strongly encourage you to protect your personal information. In some cases (such as when you are under 13), we employ automated tools and other techniques so as to help comply with legal requirements concerning your personal information. In all cases, you are not allowed to share personal information of others, including through any comment or message posted on Group walls, private or public chats, forums or personal posts. Personal information includes: Full name; Email; Password; Home or other address; Telephone number; Social security, passport, or national identity number; Real life, personal, or family photos (these are not permitted to be uploaded for community safety); and other personally identifiable information.

> Certain trades are allowed through Roblox. (Found by clicking on "Trade" on the toolbar). No other method of trading is permitted on or off Roblox.

> Offsite website links, services, and additional 3rd party content are not permitted on Roblox with the following exceptions: YouTube, Twitter, Twitch. Users under the age of 13 are not permitted to share YouTube, Twitter, Twitch links for their privacy and safety. Permitted offsite links, content, or references must contain Roblox appropriate content or your account will be moderated up to immediate termination. Using partial links, filter-breaking, using permitted website links to indirectly link to non-permitted sites, content, or services, describing or otherwise encouraging users to go to unpermitted offsite links, content, or services is also not allowed.

> **Building your game.** When building your game, it’s important to do the following: Filter all chat and text. Developers must pass all chat and/or game text through Roblox’s filtering system. Roblox scans all chat communication and player inputted text for the safety of our users and legal compliance reasons, including the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). All chat and content must also be reportable through the Report Abuse system.

> Don’t build a game that encourages (or redirects) users to go off Roblox.

> **Do not ask for or collect (or allow the transfer between players in your game) any personally identifiable information (PII)**. For example, you should not ask for a player’s first and last name, age, home or physical address, something that contains a person’s image or voice (such as a photograph, video or audio file), social security number, passport number (or national identity number), phone number or email address (or other forms of online contact information).

> **Do not create promotions offering prizes of any sort (including contests, raffles, lotteries, chain letters or any kind of giveaway)**. It is okay to offer players promo codes for in-game items only so long as they are not in exchange for something (e.g., in exchange for a thumb up on your game).

> All text in uploaded images must be clearly visible to Roblox moderators. Images with tiny, unclear, or unreadable text will be blocked from upload.
