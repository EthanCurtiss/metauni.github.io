# Theory

Architecture is sometimes defined as the art and science of designing physical spaces. Frank Lloyd Wright said more poetically that

> The mission of an architect is to help people understand how to make life more beautiful, the world a better one for living in, and to give reason, rhyme, and meaning to life.

While buildings are static, people are dynamic; guiding the flows of matter and attention in physical spaces are very much the concern of an architect, both of physical and virtual spaces. This webpage is a place for collecting notes about the *mechanics of metauni* as they evolve. It is intended to be a practical document: as a designer of virtual spaces, what are best practices for making them beautiful and useful?

Some background knowledge about how lectures in metauni work: players walk their character from the spawn point in the world to a set of boards and

* Attach as Listener to an orb, perhaps briefly chat before the beginning of the lecture.
* Engage Orbcam to listen
* At some interval (perhaps every few boards, perhaps per set) disengage Orbcam and navigate their character to the next set of boards
* Re-engage Orbcam

> The problem is that passively watching a lecture does not quite light up enough different parts of the brain for focus to flow naturally

Antics give a way of distracting some part of your mind that is itching to do something, in a way that isn't disruptive (and actually is in some strange way constructive) and is sufficiently in-context that the other part of your mind can continue to focus.

## Rhythm

The illusion of being physically present in a virtual space is a powerful tool. It is desirable to have regular prompts to "re-enter" the illusion of being physically present. E.g. the boards come in sets, and we have developed a habit of exiting orbcam to move our character to the next set of boards and then re-entering orbcam. It's not a coincidence I think that the board climbing in the screenshot started shortly after one of those transitions - it's almost an invitation to engage your brain for a bit in the illusion of moving around.
