# Festival 2023

On the 14th of January 2023, metauni will turn two years old. Around that time we'll hold a day-long festival, with short talks from a wide range of speakers in areas including logic, mathematics, computer science, physics, game programming, neuroscience, AI and more. Young presenters (e.g. undergraduate or graduate students) are particularly encouraged to speak. The first [metauni Festival](https://metauni.org/posts/festival/festival) was held in August 2021.
