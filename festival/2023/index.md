# Festival 2023

On the 14th of January 2023, [metauni](https://www.metauni.org) will turn two years old. Around that time we'll hold a day-long festival, with short talks (most will be 30min) from a wide range of speakers in areas including logic, mathematics, computer science, physics, game programming, neuroscience, AI and more. Young presenters (e.g. undergraduate or graduate students) are particularly encouraged to speak. The goal is to have a bit of fun, learn about something from outside our own fields, and continue to figure out how to run events like this in virtual worlds.

Organisation of the event is taking place in the [metauni Discord](https://discord.gg/9yBaAxPSK8) in the channel `#festival-2023`. If you would like to give a talk (*please!*) then propose a topic to speak about in the Discord channel. The first [metauni Festival](https://metauni.org/posts/festival/festival) was held in August 2021.
