# Festival 2023

On the 14th of January 2023, [metauni](https://www.metauni.org) will turn two years old. Around that time we'll hold a day-long festival, with short talks (most will be 30min) from a wide range of speakers in areas including logic, mathematics, computer science, physics, game programming, neuroscience, AI and more. Young presenters (e.g. undergraduate or graduate students) are particularly encouraged to speak. The goal is to have a bit of fun, learn about something from outside our own fields, and continue to figure out how to run events like this in virtual worlds.

Organisation of the event is taking place in the [metauni Discord](https://discord.gg/9yBaAxPSK8) in the channel `#festival-2023`. If you would like to give a talk (and please do) then propose a topic to speak about in the Discord channel; mentorship on giving talks is available. The first [metauni Festival](https://metauni.org/posts/festival/festival) was held in August 2021.

## Confirmed speakers

We hope to have about twenty speakers, spread across enough timeslots so that no matter your timezone there is a bunch of interesting talks to attend. So far the list of speakers is:

* *Ethan Curtiss*
* *Dan Murfet*
* *Adam Dorr*
* *Will Troiani*
* *Lucas Cantor*

## Instructions

At metauni most talks are given with a tablet, writing on a board. You can also give a slide talk, but these will have to be sent to an organiser at least a day before to be uploaded and placed into the world. Please see the [general instructions](https://metauni.org/posts/instructions/instructions) for how to get into metauni, and the [speaker instructions](https://metauni.org/posts/instructions/instructions-admin) for more detailed information on giving a talk in the virtual environment.
